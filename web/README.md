## About the project 🚀

This application is a study project, made by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com/) on NLW E-Sports.

The application is a way to find a duo that likes and play the same game to play together, like a tinder of games but without the like system.

To learn more, i'll stablish some rules and steps to continue with the application.

This is the web application made with ReactJS.

## Technologies 💻

- [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/)
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/ptbr/docs/intro)

## Running the application  🏁

You shold have installed on yout enviroment: NodeJS (Version 16). NVM is a plus, because you can use the command line to setup your node version.

On terminal, use `nvm use`, `npm install` and `npm run dev` to run the application.

You can access the application on localhost using `http://http://127.0.0.1:5173/`. 

Good programming day!

### Next steps 🎉 

- [ ] Responsive application
- [ ] Slider for the game show
- [ ] Select component with RadixUI
- [ ] Fields validation for form using React Hook Form
- [ ] Gradient for the "duo" phrase
- [ ] Authentication with discord (the user does not have to type his name on discord)
- [ ] List of duos for Web
- [ ] Option to add a new game that isn't in the list (only logged users can do this)
- [ ] Use pure css and remove tailwindcss (it's cool, but the code smell is to big)
